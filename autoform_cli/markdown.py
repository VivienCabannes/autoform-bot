"""Shared Markdown primitives for the deterministic blueprint checks.

The audit, the coverage contract, and the renderer must agree on what counts as
published Markdown. When each one carried its own regular expressions they
disagreed in ways that failed open: a table hidden inside an HTML comment was
treated as authoritative, and a link missing its closing parenthesis satisfied a
check even though it never renders as a link. This module is the single place
those rules live.

Two ideas run through everything here:

* Only *visible* Markdown carries meaning. Fenced code blocks, indented code
  blocks, and HTML comments are documentation about a contract, never the
  contract itself.
* Line numbers are part of the diagnostic. Masking never changes how many lines
  a document has, so a caller can always report the author's own line number.

Where a rule has to predict what a reader sees, it follows the configured
renderer rather than an approximation of it. Anchor generation in particular
reproduces Python-Markdown's ``toc`` slugging and unique-ID behaviour, because a
checker that guesses at anchors both rejects valid fragments and accepts
fragments that never appear on the published page. ``tests/test_markdown.py``
holds a differential test that compares this module against Python-Markdown
itself, so the two cannot drift apart unnoticed.
